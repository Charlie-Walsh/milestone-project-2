<h1 align=center>Card Flip!</h1>

<p>Card Flip! is a simple card memory game designed for children. Primarily this will be designed for large to medium device sizes as this is what a young child would typically use, however it will be responsive across common device sizes. </p>

## Target Audience

* This little memory game is aimed at children aged 2+ as a bit of fun that parents can play along with too.

* With this in mind instructions will be aimed at the parent, as a young child will not neccesarilly be able to read, but will remain simple none the less to aid older children that may be playing on their own.

## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

### First Time Visitor

* The purpose of the page should be immediately obvious to the user as soon as it is loaded - to have fun!

* Players should be able to access everything they need in as few clicks as possible.

### Returning Visitors

* Returning players should be able to start playing as soon as possible as they should be aware of how the game works from previous visits.

* Will include a score count to encourage players to return and beat their previous score.

### Design

### Colour Scheme

* As this game is aimed at children it will have a bright and bubbly color scheme of primary colours to keep their attention.

### Typography

* Text will need to be big, clear and well spaced for our little users.

* Buttons, logo and menu links will be using Fredoka One as it's nice and big, and bubbly.

* Other text will be using Prompt as it feels similar to Fredoka One, but is less rounded and bold.

### Imagery

* Images will be child friendly. The card back was made by myself using Vectr. A simple smiley face on a bright red background.

* Card faces will be easily recognisable animal silhouettes for the player to match.

* Images sourced from:
    * [Open Clipart](http://openclipart.org)
    * [Vecteezy](http://vecteezy.com)
    * [Public Domain Pictures](http://publicdomainpictures.net)

## Testing

### Responsiveness

* I have been testing responsiveness from the bottom up. Having previewed the page ubove 1200px throughout development it makes sense to test the extremities first and work up through the betweens from there.
